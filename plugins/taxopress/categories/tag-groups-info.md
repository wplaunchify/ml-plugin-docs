## Tag Groups Info – Overview

**Source:** [https://taxopress.com/docs/tag-groups-info-overview/](https://taxopress.com/docs/tag-groups-info-overview/)

The Tag Groups Info feature is part of the Tag Groups plugin and is available as a shortcode.

You can use a shortcode to display information about your tag groups. This usually comprises the group names and the post count (the number of posts that have tags in this group).

```
[tag_groups_info]
```

The output will look like this screenshot below:

It is also possible to display only the name or the post count of one group. For more details see the [list of parameters](https://taxopress.com/docs/tag-groups-info-shortcode-parameters/).
